ForknPantry
===========
Fork'n Pantry is a project designed to get your fork in the pantry.  
It works like this:  

  1. Register for our service (Free!)
  2. Select items that you already own and add them to your pantry.
  3. View recipes that match your ingredients.

While you can view recipes on other sites, Fork'n Pantry is designed  
to only show food that you can make without going to the store.
